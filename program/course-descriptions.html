<h4>ISM 6137 - Statistical Data Mining</h4>
<p><strong>Course Length: 8 weeks / 3 credit hours</strong><br />In this class, students learn different methods and models to address data challenges. Starting with methods for data-exploration and data-visualization, students will learn how to build statistical models around the patterns in data. This course focuses on statistical aspects of data mining and has a strong emphasis on data-driven models. That is, we will start with basic principles of linear regression models, and discuss when linear models are reasonable to employ and when their linearity assumption breaks down. We will then discuss different ways of relaxing the linearity assumption and composing more powerful models.</p>
