<p><strong>Successful technologists</strong> in any field share a few key attributes: collection, organization, integration, analysis, and management of data and information. For the operation and management of modern enterprises, these traits are not just beneficial – they are essential. Opportunities in the business world of data management are constantly expanding.  Now, more than ever, there is an increased demand for database managers to build strong foundations for the development of strategic business systems.  </p>

<p>With decades of experience preparing graduates for careers in the technology industry, the University of South Florida has a unique perspective on the skills you are going to need to excel in the business. We have applied that knowledge in crafting the curriculum for our online Master of Science in Management Information Systems (MS/MIS) degree program.</p>

<p>Although the master’s degree covers a number of advanced topics – Operations and Supply Chain Process, Advanced Systems Analysis and Design, Statistical Data Mining, and more – your education will not just be traditional lectures. By interacting with international businesses and a cohort of peers from around the world in a highly interactive web-based learning environment, you will build your professional network and hone your communication skills, as you learn firsthand how the industry’s leaders operate.</p>

<p>Through case studies and in-depth research, you will gain a better understanding of what makes a successful business thrive. And throughout the  program, industry leading-faculty will share their experiences, giving even greater insight into how they have achieved success and overcome challenges. </p>

<p>Near the end of the Management Information System's degree program, you will begin the capstone Project Management course using the skills and knowledge that you have obtained throughout your courses. This course details fundamental issues for managing projects and creates an understanding of competing demands in information technology environments.  Depending on prior experience, students can prepare and take exams leading to Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) and Project Management Professional (PMP) designations.</p>
