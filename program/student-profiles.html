<h3>Olaoluwa Ola Adaramola</h3>
<p>A graduate student in management information systems, Olaoluwa Adaramola has already been offered full-time employment despite still having one semester left until graduation. He has accepted a position as a technical support engineer for the Microsoft Corporation in Irving, Texas, and he attributes his success to the opportunities afforded him through the University of South Florida College of Business. </p> 

<p> Adaramola, who graduated from the University of Lagos in Lagos, Nigeria with a computer science degree, says USF's challenging and relevant curriculum helped to propel his career. He has had the chance to participate in MIS bootcamps and networking fairs through the MIS Society student organization. He also says the opportunity to take business classes outside of the MIS program has enabled him to become a more well-rounded professional. </p>

<h3>Ravi Dhanwani</h3>
<p> Ravi Dhanwani believes the MIS program at USF is great for domestic students as well as international scholars. He wanted a graduate program that was flexible and collaborative. He found that at USF. His learning experiences such as case competitions, networking events, and corporate partnerships helped create such an atmosphere. He feels these out-of-the classroom experiences helped prepare him for a consulting career.

<h3>Moiz Ghadiyali</h3>
<p> Moiz Ghadiyali's motivation to consistently outperform comes from the belief that, through technology, he can create a positive impact on billions of people's lives across the globe. In the summer of 2011, Ghadiyali, an international graduate student in the College of Business’ Information Systems and Decision Sciences Department, interned for Microsoft in Boston, MA. During his internship he was responsible for designing, developing, and testing a feature for Microsoft Sharepoint’s future upgrade release.

<p>Prior to attending USF, Ghadiyali worked as a software developer for Accenture India, a global management consulting, technology services, and outsourcing company.</p>

<p>Ghadiyali, who earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Technology from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute in Mumbai, India, chose USF because of the stellar reputation of the ISDS Department’s faculty and highly flexible coursework that enabled him to study the topics of his interest. According to Ghadiyali, the lessons learned in the classroom are easily applied to work in the field, and the skills he acquired here have given him a leg up on the competition.</p>

<h3>Daniel Pulley</h3>
<p>A graduate student in the Information Systems and Decisions Sciences Department in the USF College of Business, Daniel Pulley went from studying people to studying computer systems. Pulley, a graduate of the University of South Florida's Anthropology Department, wanted to continue his education at USF, but decided he wanted to study a more technical subject such as management information systems.</p>

<p>Pulley enjoys the hands-on learning the ISDS Department provides to its students, and while he finds the curriculum quite challenging, it is also rewarding to learn such difficult material. He also appreciates the flexibility of the program, as it provides the opportunity for students to pursue specific interests.</p>

<p>While attending USF as an undergraduate, Pulley worked in the Pharmaceutical Diversion Division of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, analyzing records and data. Thanks to the contacts and resources available to him through the USF College of Business, he now works as a junior MIS analyst for the e-commerce company Jagged Peak.</p>

<h3> Jeremy Wing </h3>
<p> Jeremy Wing says USF’s MIS degree offers a bridge between technology and business. Students receive deep technological knowledge, but also understand important business principles. Technology has become an integral part of every business, and businesses need people who speak the IT language. Despite the economy, people who can speak both languages have jobs waiting for them.
